# GUNS
GAN-based Underwater Noise Simulator 
This is the readme for the sourcecodes of the GAN based underwater noise simulator.

*Please cite the paper "On Generative-Adversarial-Network-Based Underwater Acoustic Noise Modeling" if you use our codes and datasets for comparison or other subjects*

The codes have been tested on tensorflow 1.9.0 + Python 3.6
